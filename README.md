# Java Swing component to display and interact with online maps.

- Supports OpenStreetMap style slippy maps
- Supports WMTS maps
- Supports QUAD tile maps (e.g virtual earth)
- Supports most CRS projections (via proj4j)
- Supports multiple layer maps with transparency/zoom offsets
- Comes with example application and example map definitions.
- Supports user overlays - you can plot anything on the map (waypoints, GPS tracks etc)

# Samples:
jMaps comes with sample demo application. 
It is also an example of using the jMaps component in your own application.
Here's a few pictures telling thousand words ;)
- WMTS Map of Czech Republic
